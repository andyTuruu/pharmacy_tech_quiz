      "question": "According to DEA regulations, Schedule II controlled substances must be stored in the pharmacy:",
      "options": [
        "In a securely locked, substantially constructed cabinet or safe",
        "On the same shelves as other prescription medications",
        "In a locked refrigerator at all times",
        "In plain view near the pharmacy counter"
      ],
      "correctOption": 0,
      "points": 30,
      "explanation": "Federal law allows two options: either store Schedule IIs (and other controls) in a securely locked cabinet/safe or disperse them throughout regular stock to obstruct theft. However, most pharmacies keep CIIs in a locked safe. They definitely shouldn’t be out in plain sight or accessible. (If refrigeration is needed, the fridge should be locked too.)"

      "question": "When returning expired Schedule II medications to a reverse distributor for disposal, which form or method must be used?",
      "options": [
        "Transfer them using a DEA Form 222 (or the electronic equivalent)",
        "Document the transfer with DEA Form 106",
        "Dispose of them using DEA Form 41 without further documentation",
        "No special form is required for returning Schedule II drugs"
      ],
      "correctOption": 0,
      "points": 30,
      "explanation": "Schedule II drugs require a DEA 222 form for any transfer, including sending to a reverse distributor for destruction. The reverse distributor will then use DEA Form 41 when they destroy the drugs. DEA Form 106 is for losses/theft. There is always paperwork; you can’t just hand over CIIs without a form."

      "options": [
        "There is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to the product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death",
        "The product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences",
        "The product is not likely to cause any adverse health consequences",
        "The recall is for minor packaging issues with no health risk"
      ],
      "correctOption": 0,
      "points": 30,
      "explanation": "Class I recalls are the most serious, for defects that could cause serious health problems or death. Class II recalls involve reversible or temporary health issues, and Class III recalls are for issues unlikely to cause health harm (like packaging or cosmetic defects)."
