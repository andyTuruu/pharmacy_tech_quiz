      ],
      "correctOption": 0,
      "points": 3,
      "explanation": "ACE inhibitors (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme inhibitors) like lisinopril often cause a dry, persistent cough in some patients. This side effect is distinctive enough that if it occurs, doctors may switch the patient to an ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker). Beta-blockers can cause fatigue or slow heart rate, calcium channel blockers can cause swelling, and diuretics increase urination, but those don't typically cause a cough."

    {
      "question": "A patient's profile shows a severe penicillin allergy, but you receive a new prescription for amoxicillin (a penicillin antibiotic). What should the pharmacy technician do?",
      "options": [
        "Alert the pharmacist about the allergy and prescription conflict before processing",
        "Ignore the allergy since the doctor prescribed it",
        "Call the patient to ask if they've taken amoxicillin before despite the allergy",
        "Fill the prescription but attach an allergy warning label"
      ],
      "correctOption": 0,
      "points": 3,
      "explanation": "If there's an apparent allergy conflict, the technician must notify the pharmacist immediately. The pharmacist can then verify the allergy and contact the prescriber for an alternative or confirm if the prescription is intentional (in rare cases, desensitization or a different context). The technician should never ignore a documented allergy. Only the pharmacist should make clinical decisions or call the physician in this scenario."

        "Make the label easier for patients to read"
      ],
      "correctOption": 0,
      "points": 3,
      "explanation": "Tall Man lettering uses uppercase letters within a drug name (for example, hydrOXYzine vs. hydrALAZINE) to emphasize the differing parts of look-alike/sound-alike drug names. This technique helps pharmacy staff distinguish between similar names and avoid medication errors. It is not for patient readability, dosage strength, or brand indication."

      "correctOption": 0,
      "points": 3,
      "explanation": "Discussing a patient's personal health information (such as name and medications) with someone not involved in their care is a breach of HIPAA. Verifying identity with birth date, securing profiles, and using a private area for consultations are proper practices that protect patient privacy."

        "A sealed glass jar in the pharmacy"
      ],
      "correctOption": 0,
      "points": 3,
      "explanation": "Needles, syringes, and other sharp objects must be discarded in a proper sharps container\u2014typically a red, puncture-proof biohazard container. This protects anyone from needle sticks and contains any biohazard. They should never be thrown in regular trash or sinks, and recapping needles is discouraged due to risk of accidental sticks."

      "explanation": "Alprazolam (brand name Xanax) is a benzodiazepine, a class of medications used to treat anxiety and panic disorders. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor for blood pressure, diphenhydramine is an antihistamine for allergies (can cause sedation but is not a benzo), and amoxicillin is an antibiotic. Only alprazolam is a benzodiazepine for anxiety."

      ],
      "correctOption": 0,
      "points": 3,
      "explanation": "Good customer service in pharmacy involves being attentive and respectful. Actively listening to the customer's concerns and responding with empathy and clarity is essential. Using excessive jargon, being dismissive, or ignoring customers will likely lead to poor communication and dissatisfaction."

      "question": "In pharmacy sig codes, 'PRN' indicates that a medication should be taken:",
      "options": ["By mouth", "As needed", "After meals", "In the morning"],
      "correctOption": 1,
      "points": 3,
      "explanation": "\"PRN\" is a shorthand for the Latin \"pro re nata,\" meaning \"as needed.\" It tells the patient to use the medication when it's required (for example, for pain or allergy symptoms), rather than on a fixed schedule. It does not mean by mouth (po), after meals (pc), or morning (qam)."

        "Class II recall"
      ],
      "correctOption": 1,
      "points": 3,
      "explanation": "A Class I recall is the most urgent type of recall, used when there is a reasonable probability that using the product will cause serious harm or death (for example, a life-threatening labeling mix-up). Class II recalls involve products that might cause temporary or medically reversible adverse effects (or a remote chance of serious harm), and Class III recalls are for products unlikely to cause harm (usually for quality issues). A market withdrawal is typically for minor issues not subject to FDA recall classifications."

      ],
      "correctOption": 1,
      "points": 3,
      "explanation": "When a language barrier exists, the technician should seek translation assistance. This might involve finding a bilingual staff member, using translated information sheets, or utilizing translation services. Simply speaking louder or refusing service is inappropriate and ineffective."

      "correctOption": 1,
      "points": 3,
      "explanation": "The metric conversion is: 1 liter = 1000 milliliters. This is a fundamental conversion (since \"milli\" means one-thousandth, 1000 mL make up 1 L)."

        "Bacterial infections",
        "High cholesterol"
      ],
      "correctOption": 1,
      "points": 3,
      "explanation": "Insulin is essential for managing Type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas produces little or no insulin. It helps lower blood glucose by facilitating its uptake into cells. While insulin can also be used in advanced Type 2 diabetes, it is the cornerstone of therapy for Type 1. It has no role in treating infections (antibiotics do that), high cholesterol (statins), or depression."

      "correctOption": 1,
      "points": 3,
      "explanation": "\"Every other day\" means the patient takes a dose once every two days. Over 30 days, they will take about 15 doses (since 30 days/2 = 15). In other words, the patient takes the medication on 15 of those 30 days, which requires 15 tablets. (If it were once daily, it would be 30 tablets for 30 days.)"

      "correctOption": 1,
      "points": 3,
      "explanation": "Oxycodone is an opioid pain medication (narcotic) and is tightly controlled due to its potential for abuse. Ibuprofen and aspirin are NSAIDs (non-opioid pain relievers), and acetaminophen is a non-opioid analgesic/antipyretic. They are not classified as opioids."

      "correctOption": 2,
      "points": 3,
      "explanation": "Proper inventory rotation involves using the \"first expiring, first out\" method. Medications with the nearest expiration dates should be placed in front or on top so that they are dispensed before they expire. Newer stock (with later expirations) should be placed behind older stock. This prevents waste from expired medications. Separating or ignoring them would risk letting them expire."

For Schedule III, IV, and V, you may estimate the count **only** if the stock bottle size is 1000 dosage units or fewer; if the container holds more than 1000 units, an exact count is required. It is not true that lower schedules can be skipped or that estimation is always okay. And while many pharmacies choose to exactly count everything, the law specifically requires exact counts for CIIs and large containers of CIII\u2013V."

      "explanation": "Hydroxyzine (an antihistamine) and Hydralazine (a blood pressure medication) have names that look and sound similar, but they treat very different conditions. Mix-ups between them have occurred, so Tall Man lettering (hydrOXYzine vs. hydrALAZINE) is used to help differentiate them. The other pairs either don't sound as similar or are less commonly confused. Always be cautious with LASA drugs to prevent errors."

      "options": [
        "Ear drops can safely be used as eye drops if sterile",
        "Ophthalmic preparations are generally not sterile",

      ],
      "correctOption": 3,
      "points": 5,
      "explanation": "Ophthalmic drops are manufactured to be sterile and gentle enough for the eyes. Because of this, an eye drop can be used in the ear if needed (for example, in absence of an ear drop), and it generally will not cause harm. However, otic drops are not necessarily sterile or formulated for eyes and should **never** be used in the eyes, as they could cause infection or irritation. Ophthalmic preparations are sterile; ear drops might not be."

      "question": "If the pharmacy does not have enough stock to fill the full quantity of a prescription (for example, only 10 tablets available on a 30-tablet order), what is the best course of action?",
      "options": [
        "Refuse to fill the prescription until the full quantity is available",
        "Give the patient someone else's remaining tablets to cover the shortage",
        "Substitute the medication with a different drug that is in stock",

      ],
      "correctOption": 3,
      "points": 5,
      "explanation": "When a pharmacy is short on stock, it can offer a partial fill. The patient receives the quantity available, and the remaining balance is dispensed once the pharmacy obtains more stock (this is often done at no extra cost or additional co-pay if it's part of one prescription). The patient should be informed and a plan made to get the rest. It's not appropriate to refuse necessary medication (unless instructed by the patient or prescriber), never substitute a different drug without prescriber approval, and certainly never share another patient's medication."

      "correctOption": 3,
      "points": 5,
      "explanation": "If a prescription appears suspicious or possibly fraudulent, the technician should alert the pharmacist right away. The pharmacist can then verify authenticity by contacting the prescriber or take appropriate action (which may include refusing to fill and notifying authorities if it's forged). A technician should never simply fill a questionable Rx, nor directly accuse the patient (safety and proper protocol must be maintained)."

They also must be re-certified if the unit is relocated or if repairs are made. Monthly or 5-year intervals are not sufficient to guarantee sterile conditions."

      "explanation": "Suspected impairment at work (due to substances or other issues) is a serious matter that can endanger patients. The technician should report their observations and concerns to the pharmacy manager or pharmacist-in-charge, who can then investigate and take appropriate steps (such as offering help, removing the person from duty, etc.). It's not appropriate to confront the person alone, cover up the issue, or ignore it."

      "correctOption": 3,
      "points": 5,
      "explanation": "Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is an analgesic/antipyretic but not an NSAID, as it has little anti-inflammatory effect. Ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin are all NSAIDs that reduce inflammation, pain, and fever. This distinction is important, for example, when patients need to avoid NSAIDs due to stomach issues or bleeding risk \u2013 acetaminophen might be recommended instead."

      "explanation": "Pharmacies generally cannot return dispensed medications to stock or resell them once they have left the pharmacy's control, even if unopened, because storage conditions and tampering can\u2019t be guaranteed. The proper response is to refuse to re-dispense it (no resale/refund on medications), but the pharmacy could assist in safely disposing of it if the patient doesn't need it (following proper disposal protocols rather than regular trash)."

      "correctOption": 3,
      "points": 5,
      "explanation": "In a horizontal laminar flow hood, you should work at least six inches inside the hood from the edge. This prevents room air from entering the critical area and ensures that the product is in uninterrupted HEPA-filtered airflow (first air). Working too close to the edge can allow contaminated air to flow in. So always work well inside the hood (and also avoid blocking airflow with hands or objects)."

      "explanation": "The law limits sales of pseudoephedrine (a precursor chemical for methamphetamine) to prevent diversion. A person may buy no more than 3.6 grams per day and no more than 9 grams in a 30-day period from retail stores. (The options given: 9 grams/30 days is correct. 3.6 grams is the daily cap. 30 grams would far exceed the legal limit, and 9 g per day is incorrect as it's the monthly limit, not daily.) Pharmacies must track these sales."
